             <p>I’m passionate about the web, not as a developer but instead as a consumer. I can spend hours enjoying the web doing multiple things, entertainments, news, research, studying and so forth. <br> 
              I never felt the desire of building websites or something like that. I’m happy to support others by continuously consuming their wonderful work on the web. But, for myself, I prefer to be on the other side of the web. A Consumer. <br> 
              </p>
              <p>My passion is the NETWORKING. Yes, you understood, Computer Networks is my pathway. <br>
                </p>
              
              <p>Hope you will like my small CV website. <br>
                </p>
              <p>
              Kind Regards
              </p>
      
      
      
      <p>GOD BLESS YOU</p>
